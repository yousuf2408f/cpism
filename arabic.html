Also known as “khatt,” this ancient art form has been around for centuries, and has been used to create beautiful pieces of art that represent certain beliefs and values. But what exactly is Arabic calligraphy? Arabic calligraphy is an ancient art form that uses stylized letterforms to represent the Arabic language. The letters used in Arabic calligraphy are both ornate and elegant, and can take many different forms, from traditional to contemporary. The art form has been used for centuries to create religious texts, poetry, manuscripts, and other pieces of art. What makes Arabic calligraphy so special is the fact that it’s a combination of art and communication. The letterforms used in Arabic calligraphy are unique and beautiful, but they also serve to communicate the meaning behind the words they represent. Each letter has a specific meaning, and the combination of these letters can create a powerful message. In addition to its aesthetic beauty, Arabic calligraphy also has a cultural significance.

            <h2>Ibn Muqla<span>!</span></h2>
            <p class="paragraph">One of the biggest names in developing and improving Arabic calligraphy, born in 885 AD in Baghdad, Iraq, during the Abbasid Caliphate, he started out as a tax collector before rising through the ranks and becoming the Caliph’s Vizier three different times. At this time, the Kufi style dominated the calligraphy scene, but Ibn Muqla invented new art styles that superseded the previous ones. Ibn Muqla was the one who invented the Thuluth and Al-Mansoub styles, as well as the foundations and rules for others, such as Naskh. The Naskh and Thuluth got further development throughout the centuries that followed, and calligraphers still use them today. While the Kufic style was rigid in its overall design, Naskh had a more cursive structure but wasn’t as popular and as used at the time, Ibn Muqla changed that by improving on it and using it in official decrees, and private correspondence. Ibn Muqla’s Thuluth style was new with its letters having long vertical lines with broad spacing. Its name translates to “one-third”, in reference to the maximum height for the letters on the same line must not exceed one-third of the ‘alif. As for the Al-Mansoub style, it mainly focused on three measurements: the size of the period meaning the “Noqta”, the circle with a diameter equal to the height of the alif (the first letter in the Arabic language) and, and the height of the alif.</p>
